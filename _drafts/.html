<p>We all seem to be comfortable with the ideas of knowledge capital and status, but why did I write about them?<!--more--></p>
<p>No prizes for guessing; I think they are related!</p>
<p>Some of the status games we play are about impressing people outside our clan. As Jan points out we like symbols of our status so that we don't need to fight and beat our chests in meetings. We have subtle indicators like better clothes[1. or sometimes worse clothes, e.g. Zukaberg's hoodie.], the deference of others, titles on business cards. Of course all this matters much less once everyone is talking and the brain-battle is on, but it helps set the stage.</p>
<p>Most of the status games we play are to jockey for position within the clan. BVN is bigger than Dunbar's magic number (100-150 people) for group coherence. Sydney alone is around 160! That means that there is a lot of status play needed to keep your importance[1. Sydney might even break into two tribes! E.g. North doesn't talk to South. ].</p>
<p>We have traditionally had a strongly hierarchical, but flatish structure[1. With senior versions of associates and practice directors (and arguably principals, all equal, but some more equal than others) we are getting less flat.]. That means that it's obvious who holds power. This also means that it seems obvious who one ought to try to be like to get oneself more power eventually.</p>
<p>I believe that this model of imitation and succession is what happens. I'd also like to argue that it is dangerous. This is going to be hard and I'm going to get on the wrong side of people, so I'd love if this generated some meaty comments below.</p>
<p>We all try to achieve status and, through that status, career advancement. One easy way to do this is to try to be like high status people who are on our projected path. The problem with this is that we are terrible at aiming that path!</p>
<p>[diagram of paths missing]</p>
<p>Most of the choices we make to ape high status people are unconscious. The thing that we forget[1. "Forget" is the wrong word because it implies that we could chose not to.] about when we aim for where people <em>are</em> is that it took time to get there[1. This is classic artillery stuff, aim for where they are going to be.]! By the time you catch up, they'll be old and irrelevant, and you'll be middle aged and irrelevant. You'll never pass through the status apex that they did.</p>
<p>To put it more bluntly: don't try to be like them, they are the past. For you to succeed you need to identify what a person of similar status will be like in the future and be like <em>them</em>!</p>
<p>Why have I gone on this important-person-bashing rant? I think that it's important when we're thinking about how to act today.</p>
<p>High status people define high status activities just by doing them. The important thing to notice about that is the inverse. They define low status activities by <em>not</em> doing them. We assume that the things that those people do are important and the things they don't do are worthless, and we work out our own priorities based on that.</p>
<p>This only works fine if there is no progress[1. I know that progress is a difficult concept. If we assume that I'm using in the lazy way, and not assuming any kind of teleological destiny then we'll all be OK!] and we know that's not the world we live in.</p>
<p>Enough of this abstract stuff, lets be specific. The reason I talk about knowledge capital is that creating it doesn't translate into status. If someone brings in a bucket load of cash then they are going to get a status bump. If another person creates a load of really valuable knowledge capital nobody really cares. (As a quick reminder, knowledge capital is when you get knowledge out of your head and into a format that other's can use to make them better at things.)</p>
<p>Because high status people at BVN make bucket loads of cash, that activity is high status. That means that people aspire to do the same thing. Creating knowledge capital is almost never done by high status people at BVN, that means that it is very obviously low status[1. With the notable exception of Craig's excellent piece on corrosion. I create a lot of knowledge capital, but I don't feel as if it gets me any advancement on the 'normal' path--perhaps further down the wierdo path?].</p>
<p>That leads to a social situation where even if people will privately agree that they <em>should</em> be doing something to share knowledge, when it comes to the crunch it is never prioritised highly[1. One of the things that's been discussed a lot recently is the idea that "too busy" to do something is a bullshit concept. What it really means is that that person doesn't prioritise that activity highly enough to do it. This isn't a slur on that person, it's just a lingustic pitfall. I might write more about it soon.] enough to happen. This creates an impasse. Nobody creates knowledge capital, nobody want to be the first as it's a low status activity, so it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>A status game is preventing BVN from becoming far more effective. That means that a status game is keeping your salary down. Concern about status is harming your lifestyle, your kids, the whole industry.</p>
<p>That's something to think about.</p>
